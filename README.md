# BurgerApp
This app allows you to enter a burger of your choice to be eaten, which populates in a list. The user can then 'eat' the burger from the list and the burger transfers to the eaten list. The user can then clear the burger from the eaten list. That's it. Not really a useful app when you think about it but there's more going on under the hood as far as coding goes. It is an exercise in entering items from a user interface into a relational database on the backend, and making edits to that database. 

## Technology Used
* HTML
* CSS
* Bootstrap
* Javscript
* SQL (MySql), Sequelize
* Express, NodeJS

## Future Enhancements
* Limiting to some degree what can be entered as a burger such as a condiment list. This could be an static list or one the user could update. Currently it just seems silly to enter a random burger name without any guidelines. What is the world coming to.
